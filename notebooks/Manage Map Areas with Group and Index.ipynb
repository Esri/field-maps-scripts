    "### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help ArcGIS Online / ArcGIS Enterprise administrators manage map areas. Depending on your needs, the manual map area tools in Field Maps Designer and item details may be adequate.  If your managing multiple map areas in multiple maps or having to accomodate frequent changes, a scripted approach may be preferred.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When should map areas will need to be recreated?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Re-creating the offline map area differs from updating the offline map area. When you use the Recreate action, it deletes all packages associated with the map area and re-creates them based on the offline map area's settings.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The primary reason to re-create a map area is to pick up schema changes that have occurred after you created the offline map area. For example, if you add or delete a field or change an attribute value list or range (domains), you must re-create the offline map area to pick up those changes.\n",

    "This process assumes that you are the owner of web map and that you are using either Enterprise 11.4+ or ArcGIS Online. \n",
    "\n",
    "This script can be updated to run on older versions of Enterprise (pre 2.4 ArcGIS API for Python). You would need to update `from arcgis.map import Map` to `from arcgis.mapping import webmap` along with the where webmap is referenced in code. \n",

    "### Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "The script utilizes three items that will ***need to be created*** and configured in your portal \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hosted Feature Layer \n",
    "##### `Manage Map Areas`\n",
    "- Setup Notes: Download the zipped file geodatabase and add it as an item to your portal.  The hosted feature layer and table below are both included.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - File hosted on ArcGIS Online: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2ab1be89349e4e61be674fc3e3cbfcdf\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##### `Manage Map Area Index`\n",
    "    - Purpose: The polygon hosted feature layer stores map area boundries and processing details.  You can specify if the map area applied to all web map in the group, or a specific web map item id\n",
    "    - Configuraton: Add your own map area polygons and configure details: \n",
    "        - `shape`: Required - this will be the boundary shape for your offline area - map layers will be clipped to this polygon\n",
    "        - `webmap_id`: Required - Specify which map the offline area should be included in, supports \"ALL\" web maps or a single web map item id.\n",
    "        - `status`: Required - Specify if map areas status is \"Active\" or not if you want to skip over processing.\n",
    "        - `min_scale`/`max_scale`: Required - these fields are used to identify what level of detail (lods) from the basemaps should be included. The min_scale value is always larger than the max_scale. If you're generating large file sizes for your offline packages, look to refine the max_scale value.\n",
    "        - `refresh_schedule`: Required - Specifies when the server will sync any changes to map area.  Supports: Never,Daily,Weekly,Monthly.  [More info](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/api-reference/arcgis.map.toc.html#offlinemapareamanager)\n",
    "        - `refresh_day_of_week`/`refresh_minute`/`refresh_hour`: Optional - Based on choice to `refresh_schedule`  [More info](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/api-reference/arcgis.map.toc.html#offlinemapareamanager)\n",
    "        - `description`/`title`/`tags`/`snippet`: Optional - for item properties\n",
    "        - `folder`: Optional - Specify a folder name if you want the offline map area item and the packages to be created inside a folder.\n",
    "        - More details on fields can be found here: https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/api-reference/arcgis.map.toc.html#offlinemapareamanager can be configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##### `Manage Map Area Processing Log`\n",
    "    - Purpose: Log table where processing details are stored, this table is used for reporting.\n",
    "    - Configuration: None needed, the processing script is designed to add rows to this table, but can be configured to truncate for each run as well.\n",
    "      \n",
    "#### Group:\n",
    "##### `Manage Map Areas`\n",
    "- Purpose: Group should include web maps that will have their map areas processed.  The owner and members of this group will receive email summary of processing results \n",
    "- Configuration: Any web map that you own and would like to process map areas for should be added to this group. Any users that you would like to receive processing notification should be included in this group.  This notification is optional\n",
    "\n",
    "#### After items are created\n",
    "Copy paste the item ids for `Manage Map Areas` HFL and `Manage Map Areas` group into the `Get Manage Map Areas HFL and Group` section below\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",

    "#### Authentication / Security \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook below uses built-in user (`gis = GIS(\"home\")`), which is the account you're logged onto your portal with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For information on different authentication schemes see:\n",

    "#### Processing outline: \n",
    "\n",
    "The script will create map areas for all web maps in the group `Manage Map Areas` that have an attribute status = 'Active'.  Web maps should include layers and basemap. Basemap can include a reference layer. Proxied basemaps (stored credentials) are supported.  You are required to be owner of each web map\n",
    "\n",
    "For each web map in group:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All existing map areas will be deleted, if it has offline area with status = 'Active'\n",
    "2. Map areas will be created as defined in hosted feature layer: `Manage Map Area Index`\n",
    "    - Known limitations:\n",
    "        - no more than 16 map areas can be defined for the web map\n",
    "        - a single tile/vector package or mobile database cannot exceed 4 GB\n",
    "    - Process results will be added to a process log table: `Manage Map Area Processing Log`\n",
    "    - Reference: https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/api-reference/arcgis.map.toc.html#offlinemapareamanager\n",
    "3. A summary report is emailed to members of `Manage Map Area` group\n",
    "    - Reference: https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-notebooks-documents/send-e-mail-notifications-with-arcgis-notebooks/ta-p/1329699\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on map area download / syncing:\n",
    "- When a map area is created, a copy of the data is packaged and made available for mobile users to download. This serves as the initial dataset\n",
    "- The frequency at which the initial dataset refreshes can be defined during the creation of the map area. Please ensure this is set according to the needs of the field operations.\n",
    "- When field workers download an map area, they store that copy locally on their devices. Any subsequent edits made to the layer's data will be synced back to portal.\n",
    "- In some circumstances field workers will need to remove and redownload map areas to ensure they have latest changes. \n",
    "    - Map areas recreated to include changes to schema changes, field domain changes, new layers\n",
    "    - Change to web map (form, popup, symbology) \n"
